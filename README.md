From Class Project: Guessing Game & Guessing Game Part 2

Game Design Notes:
==================
The GUESSATRONIC robot is on your screen, threatening a randomly displayed imaginary creature. The only way to save the creature is to guess the word and defeat Guessatronic. A correct letter stops the robot from moving, but an incorrect guess moves it closer. If it captures the creature, the game ends.  
Easy Level: all words 4 letters or less, no timer, wrong guesses same as twice letters in word.  
Medium Level: words up to 6 letters, no timer, wrong guesses same as letters in word.  
Hard Level: words 4 to 6 letters, 40 second timer; wrong guesses 3/4 of word length.  
Extreme Level: words 6-8 letters, 20 second timer; wrong guesses half of word length.

Potential thoughts for later:
**Try auto-advancing robot's position in hard and extreme levels based on time remaining.  
**Load different robot picture for last move position w/angled claw  
**Light up eyes!  
**CSS transforms to rotate little friend (nervous wiggling/jumping).  
**"Help me!" or "Save me!" sounds for lf.
